      "fullDescription": "Design and implement an internal developer platform (IDP) that empowers engineering teams with self-service infrastructure provisioning, CI/CD pipeline management, environment orchestration, and observability dashboards. This project demonstrates platform engineering expertise including infrastructure as code, GitOps workflows, developer experience optimization, and building tools that scale engineering productivity. Showcases technical leadership through creating force-multiplier platforms.",
