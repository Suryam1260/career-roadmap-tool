          "description": "Implement retry mechanism: on task failure, check retry_count < max_retries, if yes: increment retry_count, re-publish to queue with exponential backoff delay (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s), if no: move to dead letter queue (DLQ). Use RabbitMQ's built-in DLQ feature or implement custom DLQ. Add task timeout: if processing exceeds threshold (e.g., 5 minutes), mark as failed and retry. Ensure idempotency: tasks should be safely retryable without side effects."

Use WebSockets or SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time updates. Add task detail view: status, payload, error logs, retry history. Implement search and filters: by task type, status, date range. Show DLQ tasks with option to retry manually."

Add health check endpoints for workers and queue connectivity. Set up Docker Compose for local development: API + Workers + RabbitMQ + PostgreSQL. Deploy with horizontal scaling: run multiple worker instances behind a load balancer. Add alerting for: queue depth exceeding threshold, high failure rate, workers down."
