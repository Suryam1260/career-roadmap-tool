Create admin dashboard to view notification metrics and statistics. Set up monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana for delivery rates, latency, error rates. Implement integration tests for each delivery channel. Add load testing to validate system handles 10k+ concurrent WebSocket connections. Document API with Swagger and deployment with Kubernetes manifests."
