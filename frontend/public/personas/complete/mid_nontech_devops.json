For ELK: deploy Elasticsearch cluster (3 nodes for production), install Logstash for log processing, deploy Kibana for visualization. Configure log parsing and indexing. Set up log retention policies. Create log queries and visualizations in Kibana or Grafana. Integrate application logs with structured logging (JSON format)."

Instrument a sample microservices application with OpenTelemetry (supports multiple languages: Java, Node.js, Python, Go). Configure trace collection and storage. Create service dependency graphs to visualize microservices communication. Set up trace sampling to manage data volume.

Configure alert routing: different severity levels (warning, critical), route to appropriate channels (Slack, email, PagerDuty). Implement alert grouping and deduplication to reduce noise. Set up silences for planned maintenance. Create runbooks for common alerts linked in alert notifications."

Integrate with incident management platform (PagerDuty, Opsgenie, or VictorOps) for on-call rotation. Configure escalation policies and on-call schedules. Set up incident response workflow: alert → incident creation → page on-call engineer. Add correlation between metrics, logs, and traces for faster root cause analysis. Document observability architecture and troubleshooting playbooks."
