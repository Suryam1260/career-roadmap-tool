      "fullDescription": "Design and implement a micro frontend architecture using Webpack Module Federation or similar technology. Build a host app that dynamically loads multiple remote apps (dashboard, settings, analytics). Implement shared state management, cross-app communication, and independent deployments. This advanced project demonstrates expertise in large-scale frontend architecture highly valued at tech companies.",

          "description": "Plan the system: Host app (shell) acts as container, Remote apps (dashboard, settings, analytics, user-profile) as independent micro frontends. Choose technology: Webpack Module Federation vs single-spa vs custom solution. Define shared dependencies (React, router) and app-specific code. Plan routing strategy: host controls top-level routes, remotes handle sub-routes. Design cross-app communication: event bus vs shared store."

Configure shared dependencies with singleton: true for React/ReactDOM. Setup development environment: run all apps concurrently on different ports.

Add error boundaries for each remote to prevent cascading failures. Build shell UI: header, sidebar navigation, footer. Implement authentication and route guards. Add loading states and fallbacks for remote apps."
