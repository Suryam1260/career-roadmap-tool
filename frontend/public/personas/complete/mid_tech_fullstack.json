Define communication: synchronous (REST/gRPC for queries) and asynchronous (RabbitMQ/Kafka for events). Plan data strategy: each service has its own database (polyglot persistence)."

Product Service: product catalog, search, inventory management. Order Service: cart operations, order creation, order history. Payment Service: Stripe integration, payment processing, refunds. Each service exposes RESTful API and publishes domain events (UserCreated, OrderPlaced, PaymentCompleted)."

Implement authentication at gateway level: verify JWT before forwarding to services. Add rate limiting, request logging, and CORS handling at gateway. Implement service discovery using Consul or hardcoded service registry for development. Add health check endpoints for each service."
