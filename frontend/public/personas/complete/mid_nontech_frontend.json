Create mock API with 10,000+ rows of analytics data (users, sales, metrics). Configure dynamic imports for all heavy components. Set up performance monitoring with Web Vitals reporting. Establish performance budgets: LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1."

Add windowed infinite scroll with React Query for pagination. Optimize table re-renders with React.memo and useMemo. Implement column sorting and filtering without blocking UI. Use Web Workers for heavy data processing like aggregations and transformations."

Use next/dynamic for heavy components with SSR disabled where appropriate. Optimize images with next/image, srcset, and WebP format. Lazy load below-the-fold content with Intersection Observer. Implement prefetching for likely navigation paths."

Implement skip navigation links and landmark regions. Use semantic HTML (nav, main, aside, article). Ensure 4.5:1 color contrast ratio for all text. Add screen reader announcements for chart data. Test with NVDA/JAWS and axe DevTools. Create focus management for modals and dialogs."

Implement request deduplication and caching with React Query. Add error boundaries for graceful error handling. Set up Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring. Create custom performance metrics dashboard. Add Playwright tests with performance assertions. Deploy to Vercel with edge caching and document optimization strategies in README."
