      "fullDescription": "Create a production-ready performance monitoring platform that helps teams track and improve frontend performance. Implement Real User Monitoring (RUM) to capture Core Web Vitals, build analytics dashboard with trends and insights, integrate bundle analysis, automate performance regression detection in CI/CD, and provide actionable recommendations. This project demonstrates performance engineering, data visualization, platform tooling, and organizational impact - key senior engineering competencies.",

Capture Core Web Vitals: LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), INP (Interaction to Next Paint), CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift), FCP, TTFB. Add custom metrics: route change timing, API response times, component render duration. Use PerformanceObserver API for efficient metric collection. Implement batching and beacon API for data transmission. Add user context: device type, browser, connection speed, geographic location."

Add PR comments with performance comparison: before/after, passed/failed metrics, actionable recommendations. Integrate with bundle analysis: fail if bundle grew > 5% without justification.

Add performance profiling tools: React component render times, expensive re-renders detection. Deploy platform and integrate with sample application to demonstrate value."
