          "description": "Integrate web-vitals library to capture LCP, INP, CLS, FCP, and TTFB. Create a client-side SDK that sends metrics to your backend via beacon API. Track additional custom metrics: time to interactive, first input delay, long tasks. Capture device info, browser, connection type, and viewport size. Implement session replay metadata capture (without actual recording). Handle edge cases and ensure metrics don't impact page performance."

Use Recharts or Victory for charts. Implement filters by device type, browser, page, and time range. Add real-time updates using WebSocket or polling. Create a performance score calculator based on weighted averages."

Implement aggregation logic to compute percentiles and trends. Create RESTful endpoints for dashboard data. Add authentication for multi-user support. Implement rate limiting and data retention policies. Set up background jobs for daily/weekly report generation."

Generate automated weekly performance reports with trends and insights. Add comparison views: before/after deployments, A/B test variants. Implement export functionality for CSV/PDF reports. Add integration with GitHub for automated PR performance checks."

Implement proper error handling and retry logic for metric collection. Add comprehensive documentation: SDK integration guide, metric definitions, best practices. Deploy the entire stack (frontend + backend) to production. Open source the project on GitHub with detailed README and contribution guidelines."
